instructions and software to build derivatives out of 2-of-3 multisig contracts


I know people are wanting to trade AE. I am disappointed and embarrassed that the team has not yet delivered a trade-able token This is the best that I can do to help.

here is my address 15C9sgbvyurrfioFXFqtxw7XNAE3opfBru here is my master pubkey xpub661MyMwAqRbcGZtCGtNmzobsXhwbJP4iWwR7DvnevbaVzvDVhVM7fSRFAKPCrhUtmSCxoamzeUubsji8zJTYA6uP4JxxR4ZtVQrsU2NHV8t

I charge either 0.08 bitcoin, or 5% of the traded amount. Whichever is bigger. I'm sorry I can't charge less. My time is very valuable right now, I need to focus on building Aeternity. Hopefully someone else will soon offer this same service at a better price. Be very careful who you trust.

You need to have a document that both of you sign before you lock the money into the 2 of 3. It is comma separated. It contains the price at which you traded, then the address that wants to buy AE, then the address that wants to sell AE, and the number of hours after the tokens are released when you want me to measure the price, and the portion of money in the multisig that way payed by the first address (this defines the margins of the contract).

[for example](example_contract.txt)

This document says that the trade occurred at the price of 3000 AE per bitcoin. That the 15C9... address was the one buying AE, that the 157a... address was selling AE, and that they want to trade at the price of AE at the time of 5 hours after the AE tokens are trade-able on an exchange, and that the first address contributed 0.5 bitcoin to the 2 of 3. The addresses in the document must be the same as the addresses that can be generated from the pubkeys in the 2 of 3 account.

If the document isn't formatted right, I will either refuse to help you, or charge extra.

I will look at the signed document to know how many of the locked up coins go to each of the participants.
